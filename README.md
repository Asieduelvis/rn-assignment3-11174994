1. **View**: The View component is a basic React Native user interface building element. It is used to organize and style UI elements, much like the `<div>} element in web development. Views have the ability to hold additional Views as well as other UI elements like Text or Image.

2. **Text**: In React Native applications, text is displayed using the Text component. It is comparable to web development's `<span>} or `<p>} components. Numerous parameters, including fontSize, color, and fontWeight, can be used to style text components.

3. **ScrollView** : ScrollView is a component that shows a list of views or other components that can be scrolled through. It's especially helpful when you have more content than the screen can hold. Scrollview allows users to scroll through the content vertically or horizontally.

4.**TextInput** component facilitates user text input into the program. It is the web development equivalent of the `<input>} element. You can enter text, passwords, or numeric data using TextInput for a variety of applications. Features like secure text entry, customizable keyboard, and placeholder text are supported.

5. **FlatList**: In React Native, listing data is shown using the high-performance FlatList component. Only the elements that are now visible on the screen are rendered, making it ideal for rendering enormous datasets quickly. Through the usage of renderItem props and key extractors, FlatList additionally offers functionality like item selection, scrolling, and speed optimization.

6. **Image**: React Native applications use the Image component to display images. It can handle a number of image types, including SVG, JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Network URLs or local resources can be used to load images. For improved performance, the Image component also offers features like cropping, scaling, and caching
